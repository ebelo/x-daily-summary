# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

This project is currently at an early stage with no formal versioned releases. The `main` branch is the only supported version. Security fixes are applied directly to `main`.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in this project, please **do not open a public GitHub Issue**.

Instead, report it privately by:
1. Opening a [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/ebelo/x-daily-summary/issues) marked with the `security` label, **or**
2. Contacting the maintainer directly via GitHub.

Please include:
- A description of the vulnerability and its potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce the issue.
- Any relevant environment details (OS, Python version, model backend used).

You can expect an acknowledgement within a few days. This is a personal open source project maintained by one person — response times may vary.
